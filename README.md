üõí Blinkit Sales Analysis (SQL + Power BI Project)

This project consists of SQL queries and data exploration tasks performed on the "Blinkit Sales Dataset," downloaded from Kaggle. The goal is to examine the sales of products, fat content distribution, ratings, outlet performance, and sales trends across various dimensions like year, product type, outlet type, and location. The project also includes an interactive Power BI dashboard for visual data exploration.

üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset used (`BlinkIT_Grocery_Data`) includes the following key columns:

‚Ä¢ Item_Identifier: A unique ID for each product in the dataset.

‚Ä¢	Item_Weight: The weight of the product.

‚Ä¢	Item_Fat_Content: Indicates whether the product is low fat or not.

‚Ä¢	Item_Visibility: The percentage of the total display area in the store that is allocated to the specific product.

‚Ä¢	Item_Type: The category or type of product.

‚Ä¢	Item_MRP: The maximum retail price (list price) of the product.

‚Ä¢	Outlet_Identifier: A unique ID for each store in the dataset.

‚Ä¢	Outlet_Establishment_Year: The year in which the store was established.

‚Ä¢	Outlet_Size: The size of the store in terms of ground area covered.

‚Ä¢	Outlet_Location_Type: The type of city or region in which the store is located.

‚Ä¢	Outlet_Type: Indicates whether the store is a grocery store or a supermarket.

‚Ä¢	Item_Outlet_Sales: The sales of the product in the particular store. This is the outcome variable that we want to predict.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Goals

- Clean and normalize the data
- Execute aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
- Examine sales by category, fat content, outlet location/type/year
- Utilize SQL functionalities such as `CAST`, `PIVOT`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`
- Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualization
- Deliver business insights based on metrics

üìå Key SQL Queries

‚úÖ Data Exploration

- View all data:  
  `SELECT * FROM blinkit_data`
- Count total number of items:  
  `SELECT COUNT(*) AS No_Of_Items FROM blinkit_data`
- Standardize `Item_Fat_Content` values to "Low Fat" and "Regular"

üìà Sales Analysis

- Total sales:  
  `SUM(Sales)` and `SUM(Sales) / 1,000,000` (in millions)
- Average sales and rating
- Total sales of "Low Fat" items
- Total sales for the year 2022

üîç Grouped Analysis

- Sales and ratings by `Item_Fat_Content` (in 2022)
- Top 5 item types by total sales
- Sales by outlet establishment year
- Sales percentage by `Outlet_Size`
- Sales by `Outlet_Location_Type`
- Sales breakdown by `Outlet_Type`

üìä Power BI Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize sales performance and outlet insights.

üîë Dashboard Highlights

  Total Sales: $1.20M
  No. of Items: 8,523
  Average Sales: $141
  Average Rating: 3.9
  Sales by Item Type: Frozen Foods, Dairy, Household, Snacks are top contributors
  Fat Content Analysis: Low Fat vs Regular sales split
  Outlet Establishment Trend: Peak sales observed in 2018
  Sales by Outlet Size: Medium outlets perform the best
  Sales by Outlet Location: Tier 3 cities lead in sales
  Outlet Type Comparison: Supermarket Type1 contributes ~65% of total revenue

üí° Business Insights

- "Low Fat" products account for a large proportion of total sales.
- Certain item types and store types perform better than others in both average sales and overall revenue.
- Medium-sized outlets and Tier 3 locations generate the highest revenue.
- Sales peaked in 2018, followed by stabilization.
- Supermarkets, particularly Type1, are the major contributors.
- More recently opened stores (after 2010) are reporting higher sales and customer reviews.
- Frozen Foods, Dairy, and Household items drive consistent sales.
- Store location and size directly impact revenue proportion.
